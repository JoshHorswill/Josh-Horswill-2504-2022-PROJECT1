For multiplication of random polynomials of these two types, we saw an average computation time decrease of 20-25% with a decrease in allocations and size of ~30%. Division was quite similar, however due to the repacking technique that was used, efficiency was slightly behind multiplication's improvemement, with a decrease in runtime of around 20% and storage reduction of 20%\n",

Currently, the division function returns a divisor function that relies on a prime to return the analytic answer. Wouldn't it be great if we had a polynomial type that came with its own prime? Well thats what PolynomialModP is all about! As asked, this Polynomial type works as a conduit between PolynomialSparse and modulo operations by taking in a polynomial and a prime. The point of this is to simplfy the modulo operations so that they happen automatically instead of being prompted by the input of a prime number.\n",

A key assumption that was made here however is that for the four major operations and for any of that matter that involve two PolynomialModP types, their primes need to be equal, otherwise more assumptions would have to be made over which prime to use which would yield incorrect outcomes down the line. \n",

    "One of the drawbacks from using the BigInt polynomial type was that computation for basic operations became more expensive, especially with computing products. An alternative to direct multiplication, which has been used throughout each of the polynomial types thus far, is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to reconstruct the product from two polynomials, minimising the amount of BigInt operations. The CRT involves returning a unique solution to a case of simultaneously linear congruences given a coprime moduli, which can be expanded to solving the coefficients of polynomials. The way the CRT was implemented for BigInts involved three stages of functionality which are shown in order below. Firstly, we begin with an initial function that computes the CRT for two vectors of integers. To induce simplicity, the input vectors are kept at length of 2 for all functions so that iteration and stepping through for the polynomial implementation becomes analogous."

These are then used to compute the CRT coefficient of ck which latter becomes a PolynomialSparseBInt of its own. A difficulty that this function faces was the alignement of degrees, which was aided by the structure of the polynomial types. \n",

Fortunately though, as mentioned earlier in the explanation of the PolynomialSparse structure, the choice of using a strictly sorted vector of terms over a heap allowed indexing to be effective when it is needed. In this case, by finding the index that the degree occurs in a polynomial, which is found by the use of my_getindex(), we can associate the appropriate coefficent quite easily, or let 0 if the degree does not occur. With that function now in place, the final product computation function can be built from the following."

    "By declaring a variety of bounds and initial conditions, we can iterate up the tree of primes and recursively compute the CRT_polyBI function and the result that is let to be C becomes the product between the two BigInt Polynomials. At a glance, it does not appear that the CRT method makes a significant difference however, there are cases where the implementation outperforms the original product method. The standard method of polynomial product computation is very effective for short length polynomials, even for larger coefficients however, as the number of thterms in the polynomials increases, we see that the CRT begins to be the more effective method. The standard method grows fast in complexity especially for 10,000+ term polynomials, and the time and allocation subsequently increases, while the CRT method remains consistent with processing through the primes and the end result is achieved quicker and with less expense for these larger cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potential of this feature of CRT was not able to be tested fully due to resource limitations, computing the product of two polynomials of 10,000 terms length can take quite a long time! However, for computing the product of several hundred term length polynomials begins to close the gap in time between the standard method and CRT. Therefore, we can say that the CRT method demonstrates faster ability in caclulating the product for larger range polynomials, where the length of their terms span over 10,000 and for any range less than this, the original implementation has more merit in returning a quicker and less expensive result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing, a suitable measure of whether the CRT outputs a correct product is to compare to the original product function. Given PolynomialSparseBInt has already passed its own testing parameters, CRT would still hold. So, we set up a testing funciton that generates two random BigInt polynomials and compares their CRT and product output, passing if all occurances are matching.\n",

    "For \"timing\" the two operations, as mentioned there was some difficulty in processing products for larger length Polynomials due to hardware inability. The examples below show that the CRT is much slower for shorter cases bit begins to close the gap in timing as the polynomial lengths increase. I would have liked to have shown larger size polynomial products using both methods however the output through the notebook struggled greatly compared to the VSCode environemnt. Below is an example of a shorter length test, which shows us that typically the CRT method is slower for this case of product and though I was not able to clearly demonstrate it, as stated the CRT begins to gain effciciency for far larger terms.

    "This method reduces computation time significanty since far less allocations and term produts need to be made to find an output. The larger the polynomial and the larger the exponent, the more efficient in comparison it becomes, which has been indicative of the processes we have seen in the previous questions. As for factoring however, the implementation was quite diffucult. While the factoring worked, a big pitfall to the function and its daughter functions is that computation time of the process was quite slow. For small polynomials, even for large prime numbers, there was not much of a notacibble drop in speed compared to PolynomialDense, although as the length of the polynomial increase, especially for the degree, the result began to take significantly more time, arguably exponentially more time. Below is the implementation of factor for PolynomialSparse, the other types are in the factor file with their sub-functions assigned also. "

    "Most of the smaller functionality inside the factor function was easy to translate across for eachtime, very little change was required for the outputs to work. Given that the basic operations were working for each type that was constructed, each factorisation type generally worked quite well, occassionally throwing an error for having an insufficiently small prime number or a bug. With benchmarking however, stress testing the functions resulted in StackOverflowErrors, Julia continuously evaluating and other general errors. It appeared that the implementation, though effective for short length Polynomials, struggled for anything that began to exceed degrees of 8 and above. This could be due to a variety of factors, however with the limited time I had left to mitigate the issue, my best guess was that the main enumeration inside factor function began to increase in complexity and start to push corrupted terms. Unfortunately, due to these errors I was not able to perform sufficient benchmarking to show stress testing. Subsequently, I did not attempt the bonus question for factorizing with PolynomialSparseBInt."

    "Dr. Mehta's relationship to STEM and Maths in general came from a bit of inheritance from her parents' careers and her own interest and passion. She realised from a young age (stating when she was as young as three) that she had a deep interest and engagement in probability, algebra and calculus. That naturally lead her to persue mathematics at university, eventually becoming a PhD graduate in mathematical phyics. Software in general didn't become a major aspect of her career until her first major role at Opcom. She currently works at You. Smart. Thing which is a personal journey planning software that is growing rapidly. She currently works in the engineering department and as an innovation/project lead which she's held for nearly 18 months since moving on from several distinguished firms. Initially Dr. Mehta started at Opcom as a software tester and transitioned to algorithm building. She was one of the first to begin commerically using C++ & C# and when she moved on to different companies (Deswik, Carmen, Jeppesen, SilverRail) she transitioned to using Java, Python, Perl and many more. Maithili's experience on the whole has seemed to encompass quite a lot of different aspects of software, with a focus more on data analytics, to which she has been able to apply a lot of her background in mathematics along with gaining new tools from the languages she has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "What interest me the most about Dr. Mehta's journey is how much programming she had done for a \"mathematics\" graduate. I was able to resonate with some of her points in that transition from language to language becomes easier when you learn how to implement algorithms correctly first. For me the steepest part of the coding learning curves ive faced (C, Python, Julia, Java) has come from lacking algorithm skills, but as ive used Julia for longer now I can see with her point that as time goes on, the hardest thing about transitioning languages ends up remembering to use the right base function (printf vs println). While I have been familiar with ML, data analytics and statistical methods, it was really interesting to find out the \"value\" of data on a whole, with regards to what consumers want and how its regulated. I was not aware of how strict/important data regulation is nor did I know really what is valued at the moment i.e. cost algorithms. A final point I found interesting was Agile SCRUM and the modern culture of software engineering with sprints and other methodologies. Personally, I aim to go into Data Analytics after finisihng my degree and this talk has been quite helpful. A major point that I have taken away from Dr. Mehta is that data is valued quite differently and its value changes with contemporary demand, being able to pick out what is wanted vs what is needed will keep me at an advtange. Along with that point, I did like the different methodologies of thinking and how to tackle problems in DA and ML. Overall, I learned quite a lot from the talk and was especially interested in the data and software culture that Maithili covered, it was a good perspective into the next 12 months that await."
